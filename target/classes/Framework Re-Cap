Framework Re-Cap
---------------------------

1. Create an Archetype Maven Project
2. Add the necessary dependencies in pom.xml file and update the Maven project.
3. First understand the functionalities which you want to automate
4. In our current project we are automating 3 functionalities Login, Register and Search of tutorialsninja.com/demo
5. Created packages in src/test/java
	5.1 > testcases
	5.2 > testbase
6. Created Classes in the Packages above
	6.1 > testcases >> Logintest >> RegisterTest >> SearchTest
	6.2 > testbase >> TestBase
7. Created few packages in the src/main/java
	7.1 config
	7.2 testdata
	7.3 utilities
8. Classes created in the packages above
	8.1 Utilities.java
9. Created Properties files 
	9.1 > config >> config.properties
	9.2 > testdata >> testdata.properties
10. In src/test/resources, we added the testng.xml file
--------------------------------------------------------------

What are the technical things which we did so far?

1. Wrote the positive and negative test cases in the respective Test Classes using TestNG
2. Designed the TestBase class and all the Classes were extending the TestBase Class
3. Initialized the browser in the TestBase class
4. Created the Constructor of the TestBase class and defined both the properties file in that constructor
5. In Utilities.java class, created a method to generalize the DateTimeStamp especially for email id changes - 
(input data changes)
6. Made implicit and pageload time as public and final so that the hard-coding data in the TestBase class in removed
7. In respective classes (ResgisterTest, LoginTest, SearchTest), created respective constructors of these classes. 
They are all extending the TestBase class, so using the super() we could directly call the logic in the TestBase 
class constructor
8. Arranged the testng.xml file to execute the whole code
9. Pushed into Github and created a job in Jenkins and ran it.
